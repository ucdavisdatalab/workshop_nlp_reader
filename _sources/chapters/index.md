Overview
========

This week-long workshop series covers the basics of text mining and natural
language processing (NLP) with Python. We will focus primarily on unstructured
text data, discussing how to format and clean text to enable the discovering of
significant patterns in collections of documents. Sessions will introduce
participants to core terminology in text mining/NLP and will walk through
methods that range from tokenization and dependency parsing to text
classification, topic modeling, and word embeddings. Basic familiarity with
Python is required. We welcome students, postdocs, faculty, and staff from a
variety of research domains, ranging from health informatics to the humanities.

Note: this series concludes with a special session on large language models,
"The Basics of Large Language Models."


Learning Goals
--------------

By the end of this series, you will be able to:
+ Clean and structure textual data for analysis
+ Recognize and explain how these cleaning processes impact research findings
+ Explain key concepts and terminology in text mining/NLP, including
  tokenization, dependency parsing, word embedding
+ Use special data structures such as document-term matrices to efficiently
  analyze multiple texts
+ Use statistical measures (pointwise mutual information, tf-idf) to identify
  significant patterns in text
+ Classify texts on the basis of their features
+ Produce statistical models of topics from/about a collection of texts
+ Produce models of word meanings from a corpus


Prerequisites
-------------

These workshops are not an introduction to Python. Learners must have taken
[DataLabâ€™s Python Basics workshop series][basics] or have equivalent prior
experience using Python.
