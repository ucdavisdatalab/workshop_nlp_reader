Working with Large Language Models
==================================

This chapter demonstrates how to work with large language models (LLMs). We
will fine-tune a model (BERT) for a classification task and discuss the
numerous hyperparameters available to you. Then, we will work with a generative
model (GPT-2) to discuss sampling strategies and prompting.

```{admonition} Learning objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

+ Use the `transformers` interface for model training and deployment
+ Explain several of the hyperparameters that go into model training
+ Fine-tune a LLM for a classification task
+ Assess the performance of a fine-tuned model
+ Explain different sampling strategies for text generation
+ Learn the basics of prompting and prompt engineering
```

from datasets import Dataset
from transformers import (
    AutoTokenizer,

```


Fine-Tuning a BERT Model
------------------------

Our first example will involve fine-tuning an encoder model, BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We will work with a
dataset of book blurbs from the U. Hamburg Language Technology Groupâ€™s [Blurb
Genre Collection][blurbs]. These blurbs have genre tags, and we will use tags
to adapt BERT's weights to a classification task that determines the genre of a
book based on the contents of a blurb.

[blurbs]: https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/blurb-genre-collection.html


### Defining our labels

Load the data.

```{code-cell}
blurbs = pd.read_parquet("data/bert_blurb_classifier/blurbs.parquet")
```

Currently the labels for this data are string representations of genres.

```{code-cell}
blurbs["d1"].sample(5).tolist()
```

We need to convert those strings into unique identifiers. In most cases, the
unique identifier is just an arbitrary number; we create them below by taking
the index position of a label in the `.unique()` output. Under the hood, the
model will use those numbers, but if we associate them in a dictionary with the
original strings, we can also have it display the original strings.

```{code-cell}
enumerated = list(enumerate(blurbs["d1"].unique()))
id2label = {idx: genre for idx, genre in enumerated}
label2id = {genre: idx for idx, genre in enumerated}
```

Use `.replace()` to remap the labels in the data.

```{code-cell}
blurbs["label"] = blurbs["d1"].replace(label2id)
```

How many unique labels are there?

```{code-cell}
num_labels = blurbs["label"].nunique()
print(num_labels, "unique labels")
```

What is the distribution of labels like?

```{code-cell}
blurbs.value_counts("label")
```

With model-ready labels made, we create a `Dataset`. These objects work
directly with the Hugging Face training pipeline to handle batch processing and
other such optimizations in an automatic fashion. They also allow you to
interface directly with Hugging Face's cloud-hosted data, though we will only
use local data for this fine-tuning run.

We only need two columns from our original DataFrame: the text and its label.

```{code-cell}
dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(blurbs[["text", "label"]])
dataset
```

Finally, we load a model to fine-tune. This works just like we did earlier,
though the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` object expects to have an
argument that specifies how many labels you want to train your model to
recognize.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-stderr]
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name, num_labels = num_labels
)
```

Don't forget to associate the label mappings!

```{code-cell}
model.config.id2label = id2label
model.config.label2id = label2id
```


### Data preparation

With label mappings made, we turn to the actual texts. Below, we define a
simple tokenization function. This just wraps the usual functionality that a
tokenizer would do, but keeping that functionality stored in a custom wrapper
like this allows us to cast, or **map**, that function across the entire
Dataset all at once.

```{code-cell}
def tokenize(examples):
    """Tokenize strings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    examples : dict
        Batch of texts

    Returns
    -------
    tokenized : dict
        Tokenized texts
    """
    tokenized = tokenizer(
        examples["text"],
        return_tensors = "pt",
        truncation = True,
        padding = "max_length"
    )

    return tokenized
```

Now we split the data into separate train/test datasets...

```{code-cell}
split = dataset.train_test_split()
split
```

...and tokenize both with the function we've written. Note the `batched`
argument. It tells the Dataset to send batches of texts to the tokenizer at
once. That will greatly speed up the tokenization process.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-stderr]
trainset = split["train"].map(tokenize, batched = True)
testset = split["test"].map(tokenize, batched = True)
```

Tokenizing texts like this creates the usual output of token ids, attention
masks, and so on:

```{code-cell}
trainset
```

Recall from the last chapter that models require batches to have the same
number of input features. If texts are shorter than the total feature size, we
pad them and then tell the model to ignore that padding during processing. But
there may be cases where an entire batch of texts is substantially padded
because all those texts are short. It would be a waste of time and computing
resources to process them with all that padding.

This is where the `DataCollatorWithPadding` comes in. During training it will
dynamically pad batches to the maximum feature size for a given batch. This
improves the efficiency of the training process.

```{code-cell}
data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer = tokenizer)
```


### Logging

With our data prepared, we move on to setting up the training process. First:
logging training progress. It's helpful to monitor how a model is doing while
it trains. The function below computes metrics when the model pauses to perform
an evaluation. During evaluation, the model trainer will call this function,
calculate the scores, and display the results.

The scores are simple ones: accuracy and F1. To calculate them, we use the
`evaluate` package, which is part of the Hugging Face ecosystem. 

```{code-cell}
accuracy_metric = evaluate.load("accuracy")
f1_metric = evaluate.load("f1")

def compute_metrics(evaluations):
    """Compute metrics for a set of predictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    evaluations : tuple
        Model logits/label for each text and texts' true labels

    Returns
    -------
    scores : dict
        The metric scores
    """
    # Split the model logits from the true labels
    logits, references = evaluations

    # Find the model prediction with the maximum value
    predictions = np.argmax(logits, axis = 1)

    # Calculate the scores
    accuracy = accuracy_metric.compute(
        predictions = predictions, references = references
    )
    f1 = f1_metric.compute(
        predictions = predictions,
        references = references,
        average = "weighted"
    )

    # Wrap up the scores and return them for display during logging
    scores = {"accuracy": accuracy["accuracy"], "f1": f1["f1"]}

    return scores
```


### Training hyperparameters

There are a large number of hyperparameters to set when training a model. Some
of them are very general, some extremely granular. This section walks through
some of the most common ones you will find yourself adjusting.

First: epochs. The number of **epochs** refers to the number of times a model
passes over the entire dataset. Big models train for dozens, even hundreds of
epochs, but ours is small enough that we only need a few

```{code-cell}
num_train_epochs = 15
```

Training is broken up into individual **steps**. A step refers to a single
update of the model's parameters, and each step processes one batch of data.
**Batch size** determines how many samples a model processes in each step.

Batch size can greatly influence training performance. Larger batch sizes tend
to produce models that struggle to generalize (see [here][stack] for a
discussion of why). You would think, then, that you would want to have very
small batches. But that would be an enormous trade-off in resources, because
small batches take longer to train. So, setting the batch size ends up being a
matter of balancing these two needs.

[stack]: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/164876/what-is-the-trade-off-between-batch-size-and-number-of-iterations-to-train-a-neu

A good starting point for batch sizes is 32-64. Note that models have separate
size specifications for the training batches and the evaluation batches. It's a
good idea to keep the latter set to a smaller size, for the very reason about
measuring model generalization above.

```{code-cell}
per_device_train_batch_size = 32
per_device_eval_batch_size = 8
```

**Learning rate** controls how quickly your model fits to the data. One of the
most important hyperparameters, it is the amount by which the model updates its
weights at each step. Learning rates are often values between 0.0 and 1.0.
Large learning rates will speed up training but lead to sub-optimally fitted
models; smaller ones require more steps to fit the model but tend to produce a
better fit (though there are cases where they can force models to become stuck
in local minima).

Hugging Face's trainer defaults to `5e-5` (or 0.00005). That's a good starting
point. A good lower bound is `2e-5`; we will use `3e-5`.

```{code-cell}
learning_rate = 3e-5
```

Early in training, models can make fairly substantial errors. Adjusting for
those errors by updating parameters is the whole point of training, but making
adjustments too quickly could lead to a sub-optimally fitted model. **Warm up
steps** help stabilize a model's final parameters by gradually increasing the
learning rate over a set number of steps.

It's typically a good idea to use 10% of your total training steps as the step
size for warm up.

```{code-cell}
warmup_steps = (len(trainset) / per_device_train_batch_size) * num_train_epochs
warmup_steps = round(warmup_steps * 0.1)
print("Number of warm up steps:", warmup_steps)
```

**Weight decay** helps prevent overfitted models by keeping model weights from
growing too large. It's a penalty value added to the loss function. A good
range for this value is `1e-5` - `1e-2`; use a higher value for smaller
datasets and vice versa.

```{code-cell}
weight_decay = 1e-2
```

With our primary hyperparameters set, we specify them using a
`TrainingArguments` object. There are only a few other things to note about
initializing our `TrainingArgumnts`. Besides specifying an output directory and
logging steps, we specify when the model should evaluate itself (after every
epoch) and provide a criterion (loss) for selecting the best performing model
at the end of training. 

```{code-cell}
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir = "data/bert_blurb_classifier",
    num_train_epochs = num_train_epochs,
    per_device_train_batch_size = per_device_train_batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size = per_device_eval_batch_size,
    learning_rate = learning_rate,
    warmup_steps = warmup_steps,
    weight_decay = weight_decay,
    logging_steps = 100,
    evaluation_strategy = "epoch",
    save_strategy = "epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end = True,
    metric_for_best_model = "loss",
    save_total_limit = 3,
    push_to_hub = False
)
```


### Model training

Once all the above details are set, we initialize a `Trainer` and supply it
with everything we've created: the model and its tokenizer, the data collator,
training arguments, training and testing data, and the function for computing
metrics. The only thing we haven't seen below is the `EarlyStoppingCallback`.
This combats overfitting. When the model doesn't improve after some number of
epochs, we stop training.

```{code-cell}
trainer = Trainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    data_collator = data_collator,
    args = training_args,
    train_dataset = trainset,
    eval_dataset = testset,
    compute_metrics = compute_metrics,
    callbacks = [EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience = 3)]
)
```

Time to train!

```py
trainer.train()
```

Calling this method would quick off the training process, and you would see
logging information as it runs. But for reasons of time and computing
resources, the underlying code of this chapter won't run a fully training loop.
Instead, it will load a separately trained model for evaluation.

But before that, we show how to save the final model:

```py
trainer.save_model("data/bert_blurb_classifier/final")
```

Saving the model will save all the pieces you need when using it later.


## Model Evaluation

We will evaluate the model in two ways, first by looking at classification
accuracy, then token influence. To do this, let's re-load our model and
tokenizer. This time we specify the path to our local model.

```{code-cell}
fine_tuned = "data/bert_blurb_classifier/final"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(fine_tuned)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(fine_tuned)
```


### Using a pipeline

While we could separately tokenize texts and feed them through the model, a
`pipeline` will take care of all this. All we need to do is specify what kind
of task our model has been trained to do.

```{code-cell}
classifier = pipeline(
    "text-classification", model = model, tokenizer = tokenizer
)
```

Below, we put a single text through the pipeline. It will return the model's
prediction and a confidence score.

```{code-cell}
sample = blurbs.sample(1)
result ,= classifier(sample["text"].item())
```

What does the model think this text is?

```{code-cell}
print(f"Model label: {result['label']} ({result['score']:.2f}% conf.)")
```

What is the actual label?

```{code-cell}
print("Actual label:", sample["d1"].item())
```

Here are the top three labels for this text:

```{code-cell}
classifier(sample["text"].item(), top_k = 3)
```

Set `top_k` to `None` to return all scores.

```{code-cell}
classifier(sample["text"].item(), top_k = None)
```


### Classification accuracy

Let's look at a broader sample of texts and appraise the model's performance.
Below, we take 250 blurbs and send them through the pipeline. A more fastidious
version of this entire training setup would have spliced off this set of blurbs
before doing the train/test split. That would have kept the model from ever
seeing them until the moment we appraise performance to render a completely
unbiased view of model performance. But for the purposes of demonstration, it's
okay to sample from our data generally.

```{code-cell}
sample = blurbs.sample(250)
predicted = classifier(sample["text"].tolist(), truncation = True)
```

Now, we access the predicted labels and compare them against the true labels
with `classification_report()`.

```{code-cell}
y_true = sample["d1"].tolist()
y_pred = [prediction["label"] for prediction in predicted]
report = classification_report(y_true, y_pred, zero_division = 0.0)
print(report)
```

Overall, these are pretty nice results. The F1 scores are fairly well balanced.
Though it looks like the model struggles with classifying Biography \& Memoir
and Literary Fiction. But other genres, like Cooking and Romance, are just
fine. We can use a **confusion matrix** to see which of these genres the model
confuses with others.

```{code-cell}
confusion = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
confusion = pd.DataFrame(
    confusion, columns = label2id.keys(), index = label2id.keys()
)
```

Plot the matrix as a heatmap:

```{code-cell}
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5, 5))
g = sns.heatmap(confusion, annot = True, cmap = "Blues", ax = ax);
ax.set(ylabel = "True label", xlabel = "Predicted label")
plt.show()
```

For this testing set, it looks like the model sometimes mis-classifies
Biography \& Memoir as Religion \& Philosophy. Likewise, it sometimes assigns
Politics to Biography \& Memoir. Finally, there appears to be a little
confusion between Literary Fiction and Romance.


Generative Models
-----------------

We turn now to natural language generation. Prior to the notoriety of ChatGPT,
OpenAI released GPT-2, a **decoder** model (GPT stands for "generative
pretrained Transformer"). This release was ultimately made widely available,
meaning we can download the model ourselves.

```{code-cell}
checkpoint = "gpt2"
gpt_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
gpt = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
```

GPT-2 didn't have a padding token, but you can set one manually:

```{code-cell}
gpt_tokenizer.pad_token_id = 50256
print("Pad token:", gpt_tokenizer.pad_token)
```

This isn't strictly necessary, but you'll see a warning during generation if
you don't do this.


### Text Generation

Generating text from embeddings requires most of the same workflow we've used
so far. First, we tokenize:

```{code-cell}
prompt = "It was the best of times, it was the"
tokenized = gpt_tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors = "pt", truncation = True)
```

Note however that we aren't padding these tokens. Now, send to the model.

```{code-cell}
generated = gpt(**tokenized)
```

It's possible to get the embeddings from various layers of this model, just as
we did with BERT, but the component of these outputs that is relevant for
generation is stored in the `.logits` attribute. Logits are raw scores
outputted by the final linear layer of the model. For every token in the input
sequence, we get an `n_vocabulary`-length tensor of logits:

```{code-cell}
generated.logits.shape
```

Take the last of these tensors to get the logits for the final token in the
input sequence.

```{code-cell}
last_token_logits = generated.logits[:, -1, :]
```

Now, we apply **softmax** to the logits to convert them to probabilities. The
equation for softmax is below. For a vector of logits $z_i$ elements, the
softmax function $\sigma(z)_i$ is:

$$
\sigma(\mathbf{z})_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{z_j}}
$$

The result is a non-negative vector of values that sums to 1. Here's a toy
example:

```{code-cell}
z = [2.0, 1.0, 1.0]
exponentiated = [np.exp(val) for val in z]
summed = np.sum(exponentiated)

exponentiated / summed
```

Again, this sums to 1:

```{code-cell}
np.sum(exponentiated / summed)
```

In practice, we use a PyTorch function to do these steps for us.

```{code-cell}
probs = F.softmax(last_token_logits, dim = -1)
```

What is the most likely next token?

```{code-cell}
next_token_id = torch.argmax(probs).item()
next_token = gpt_tokenizer.decode(next_token_id)

print("Next predicted token:", next_token)
```

Use the model's `.generate()` method to do all of this work:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [remove-stderr]
generated_token_ids = gpt.generate(**tokenized, max_new_tokens = 4)
generated = gpt_tokenizer.decode(generated_token_ids.squeeze())

print("Full sequence:", generated)
```

Wrapping everything in a `pipeline` makes generation even easier.

```{code-cell}
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model = gpt, tokenizer = gpt_tokenizer)
```

```{code-cell}
generated ,= generator(prompt, max_new_tokens = 4)
print(generated["generated_text"])
```

Want multiple outputs? It's a simple tweak.

```{code-cell}
generated = generator(prompt, max_new_tokens = 4, num_return_sequences = 5)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```


### Sampling strategies

Note that we do not get the same output every time we generate a sequence. This
is because the model samples from the probability distribution produced by the
softmax operation. There are a number of ways to think about how to do this
sampling, and how to control it.

**Greedy sampling** takes the most likely sequence every time. Setting
`do_sample` to `False` will enable you to generate sequences of this sort.
These will be **deterministic** sequences: great for reliable output, bad for
scenarios in which you want varied responses.

```{code-cell}
generator(prompt, max_new_tokens = 4, do_sample = False)
```

**Top-k** sampling limits the sampling pool. Instead of sampling from all
possible outputs, we consider only the top `k`-most probable tokens. This makes
outputs more diverse than in greedy sampling---though you'd need to find some
way to set
`k`.


```{code-cell}
generated = generator(
    prompt,
    do_sample = True,
    max_new_tokens = 4,
    top_k = 50,
    num_return_sequences = 5
)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```

Similar to top-k sampling is **top-p**, or **nucleus sampling**. Instead of
fixing the size of the sampling pool, this method considers the top tokens
whose cumulative probability is at least `p`. You still have to set a value for
`p`, but it's more adaptive than the top-k logic.

```{code-cell}
generated = generator(
    prompt,
    do_sample = True,
    max_new_tokens = 4,
    top_p = 0.9,
    num_return_sequences = 5
)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```

Adjust the **temperature** parameter to control the randomness of predictions.
The value you use for temperature is used to scale the logits before applying
softmax. Lower temperatures (<1) make model outputs more deterministic by
sharpening the probability distribution, while higher temperatures (>1) make
model outputs more random by flattening the probability distribution.

Here is low-temperature output:

```{code-cell}
generated = generator(
    prompt, 
    do_sample = True,
    max_new_tokens = 5,
    temperature = 0.5,
    num_return_sequences = 5
)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```

And high-temperature output:

```{code-cell}
generated = generator(
    prompt,
    do_sample = True,
    max_new_tokens = 5,
    temperature = 50.0,
    num_return_sequences = 5
)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```

Set temperature to 1 to use logits as they are.

Finally, there is **beam searching**. A beam search involves tracking multiple
possible generation sequences. Once the model generates them all, it selects
the sequence that has the highest cumulative probabilities. Each of these
sequences is known as a **beam**, and the number of them is the **beam width**.
The advantage of beam searching is that the model can navigate the probability
space to find full sequences that may be better overall choices for output than
if it had to construct a single sequence on the fly. Its disadvantage: beam
searches are expensive, computationally speaking.

```{code-cell}
generated = generator(
    prompt,
    do_sample = True,
    max_new_tokens = 5,
    num_beams = 10,
    num_return_sequences = 5
)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```

Mixing these strategies together usually works best. Use a `GenerationConfig`
to set up your pipeline. This will accept a number of different parameters,
including an **early stopping** value, which will cut generation off in
beam-based searches once `num_beams` candidates have completed.

```{code-cell}
config = GenerationConfig(
    max_new_tokens = 25,
    do_sample = True, 
    temperature = 1.5,
    top_p = 0.8, 
    num_return_sequences = 5,
)
generator = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model = gpt,
    tokenizer = gpt_tokenizer,
    generation_config = config
)
```

```{tip}
There are several other parameters you can set with `GenerationConfig`,
including penalties for token repetition, constraints for requiring certain
tokens to be in the output, and lists of token IDs that you do not want in your
output. Check out the documentation [here][gc].

[gc]: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.3/en/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig
```

Let's generate text with this setup.

```{code-cell}
generated = generator(prompt)
for seq in generated:
    print(seq["generated_text"])
```


Prompting
---------

Thus far we have been working with raw generation. But the surge in popularity
around LLMs is in part due to the models that have been trained for interactive
prompting. Typically, this kind of training involves fine-tuning a big model on
a host of different tasks/data, which range from question--answer pairs to
ranked-choice model responses. Prompting itself is a huge topic, so we will
focus on how you might use more interactive LLMs for academic research.


### For chat

Models in Meta's Llama series as well as Mistral AI's products are good options
for conversational agents. You can download them from Hugging Face. There are a
number of different sizes to choose from, which come with (probably
unsurprising) trade-offs: smaller models, in the 7-13 billion parameter range,
have a far less memory footprint than models with 30 billion parameters or
more, but the latter models are more accurate.

Use `transformers` to load one of these models. The library is also integrated
with a suite of optimization/quantization packages that can help you manage
computational resources, like [PEFT][peft], [bitsandbytes][bnb] and [flash
attention][fa].

[peft]: https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/index
[bnb]: https://pypi.org/project/bitsandbytes/
[fa]: https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention

```py
chatbot = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16,
    device_map = "auto"
)
```

Prompting these models requires you to define **roles** for the chatbot and the
user.

```py
chat = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You answer all prompts with 'meow'."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you tell me more about NLP?"}
]
```

```py
response = chatbot(prompt, max_new_tokens = 10)
print(response["generated_text"])
```

```
[{'role': 'system', 'content': "You answer all prompts with 'meow'."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you tell me more about NLP?'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '  Meow! ðŸ˜º'}]
```

If you'd like to fine-tune this kind of model, you can follow the general
workflow from above. The data structures you'll use range from question--answer
pairs (separated by some kind of delimiter, eg. "### Assistant ###" and "###
User ###") or conversation trees (multiple question--answer pairs). See the
[OpenAssistant][oa] datasets for examples.

### Template prompting

In the context of prompting, it's helpful to make a distinction between
**chat** models, which are trained for conversational exchanges, and
**instruct** models, which are trained to follow some instruction in a prompt.
Many models and platforms will mix these types of models, but the distinction
is useful for tasks that involve information extraction.

This is also where you might think about **prompt engineering**: tweaking how
you write a prompt to optimize some task you'd like to perform. Typically
you'll need to go through some trial and error to get the right prompt, but in
general you want to think about supplying some kind of example or format for
the model to use when it returns a response.

Below, we show an example of using one of Microsoft's [Phi-3][phi] models to
extract information from text.

```py
config = GenerationConfig(
    max_new_tokens=100,
    num_beams=2,
    early_stopping=True,
    temperature=1
    num_return_sequences=1
)
extractor = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"
    generation_config = config,
    device = "auto_map"
)
```

Here is a profile:

```{code-cell}
profile = (
    "Tyler Shoemaker is a Postdoctoral Scholar affiliated with the DataLab ",
    "at the University of California, Davis. A digital humanist, he conducts ",
    "research on language technology, focusing on how methods in natural ",
    "language processing (NLP) crosscut the interpretive and theoretic ",
    "frameworks of literary and media studies. At the DataLab, Tyler ",
    "develops and implements NLP methods across a variety of research ", 
    "domains ranging from early modern print to environmental and health ",
    "sciences."
)
```

Now, we want to get the name, position, and keywords from this profile. We do
this by writing out the template of what we want and interpolating the relevant
information directly into the prompt string.

```{code-cell}
prompt = (
    f"Extract the name and position from the researcher's profile. "
    f"Then include up to five keywords that best describe "
    f"their work. Use commas to separate keywords.\n"
    f"Profile: {profile}\n"
    f"1. Name: <name>\n"
    f"2. Position: <position>\n"
    f"3. Keywords: <keywords>\n"
)
```

The full prompt looks like this:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [output_scroll]
print(prompt)
```

Let's send it to the model. We can set `return_full_text` to `False` to get
only those parts of the generated text that correspond to the extracted
information.

```py
response ,= extractor(prompt, return_full_text = False)
print(response["generated_text"])
```

```
Name: Tyler Shoemaker
Position: Postdoctoral Scholar
Keywords: language technology, natural language processing, literary and media
studies, digital humanities, environmental sciences.
```

This works well! But be warned: you will need to parse this raw output into
some structured format if you want to use this information for some other task.
Model outputs often require additional postprocessing like this, especially if
you're sending them down the data science pipeline.


### Retrieval-augmented generation

Finally, there is **retrieval-augmented generation**, or RAG. This is something
you'd do if you wanted to think about classic information retrieval tasks like
search, document similarity analysis, and so on. We won't show a concrete
example, but the basic idea is this:

+ First, you train an encoder model like BERT on question--answer pairs (or
  some other kind of paired data)
+ Send every document in your corpus to this model to create an embedding for
  it
+ When you'd like to search/summarize these documents, use that same document
  to create an embedding for a search string/prompt. Then, return the k-most
  similar documents for that new embedding
+ Interpolate document text into your search string/prompt and then send that
  to a generative model, which will summarize the results
